When YOLOE_test.ipynb is rendered by GitHub, links to images in Table 1 and Table 2 do not work. Here's what I got when I googled for advice:

When "Jupyter Book" links to images within a notebook fail to display on GitHub, the issue typically stems from how the image paths are handled during the build process and how GitHub renders them.

Common Causes and Solutions:

-   **Relative Paths and Directory Structure:**
    
    -   **Problem:** Images are linked using relative paths within the notebook, but the generated HTML or the way GitHub serves the files doesn't correctly resolve these paths.
    -   **Solution:** Ensure a consistent and correct relative path structure. For example, if your images are in an `images/` folder at the same level as your `notebooks/` folder, and you're linking from a notebook, the path might be `../images/my_image.png`.
    -   **Jupyter Book Specifics:** When building your book, you might need to manually copy or configure the build process to include your image directory in the output. The `cp -a images/* my-book/content/images/` command is an example of how to copy images to the book's content folder.
    
-   **GitHub's Case Sensitivity:**
    
    -   **Problem:** GitHub's file system is case-sensitive, and a mismatch between the image filename in your code and the actual filename on GitHub will prevent the image from displaying.
    -   **Solution:** Verify that the case of your image filenames in the notebook markdown or HTML exactly matches the case of the files in your GitHub repository.
    
-   **Image Embedding vs. Linking:**
    
    -   **Problem:** While attached images work within a Jupyter notebook environment, they might not be correctly rendered in the static HTML generated by Jupyter Book or displayed directly on GitHub.
    -   **Solution:** For robust display, especially in static builds, it's generally more reliable to link to images stored externally (within your project's `images/` folder) rather than embedding them directly within the `.ipynb` file.
    
-   **Jupyter Book Configuration:**
    
    -   **Problem:** The Jupyter Book configuration (`_config.yml`) or MyST settings might not be correctly configured to handle images.
    -   **Solution:** Review your `_config.yml` for any image-related settings. If using MyST Markdown, explore the `html_image` extension or `{image}` directive for better control over image display.
    
-   **Build Issues and Warnings:**
    
    -   **Problem:** Jupyter Book might be encountering errors or warnings during the build process related to image handling, which could lead to missing images in the final output.
    -   **Solution:** Use the `--strict` flag during your `jb build` command to catch and address any warnings or errors that might be preventing images from being correctly included or linked.
    

By carefully checking these points and ensuring your image paths, filenames, and Jupyter Book configurations are correct, you can resolve most issues with images failing to display on GitHub.
